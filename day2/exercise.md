Code:
 ```javascript
const sentence = `%I $am@% a %tea@cher%, &and& I lo%#ve %te@a@ching%;. The@re $is no@th@ing; &as& mo@re rewarding as educa@ting &and& @emp%o@weri@ng peo@ple. ;I found tea@ching m%o@re interesting tha@n any ot#her %jo@bs. %Do@es thi%s mo@tiv#ate yo@u to be a tea@cher!? %Th#is 30#Days&OfJavaScript &is al@so $the $resu@lt of &love& of tea&ching`;

const cleanText = sentence.replace(/[^a-zA-Z\s]/g, "").toLowerCase();

const words = cleanText.split(/\s+/);

const counts = {};

words.forEach(word => {
  counts[word] = (counts[word] || 0) + 1;
});

const mostFrequent = Object.entries(counts).reduce((a, b) => a[1] > b[1] ? a : b);

console.log(`Most frequent word: '${mostFrequent[0]}' (${mostFrequent[1]} times)`);
