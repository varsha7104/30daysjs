# Today We are knowing the datatypes in the JavaScript
## DataTypes:
Generally The datatypes are of the two types :<br>
1) Primitive DataType <br>
2) Non Primitive Data type(Object References)<br>
## Primitive Data types:
Primitive Data types include in Java Script include:
1) Numbers-Integer,floats
2) Strings: Any data under single quote ,double quotes or backtick quote 
3) Booleans- true or false values 
4) Null -empty values  or no values 
5) Undefined - a declared variable without a value 
6) Symbol - A unique value that can be generated by Symbol constructor
## Non Primitive datatypes:
Non Primitive Data types include in Java Script include:
1) Objects 
2) Arrays <br>
Primitive datatypes are immutuable (which means which can't be changed).Once a primitive datatype created you can't modify it.

 

```javascript
let word='JavaScript'
word[0]='y'
console.log(word)
```
Output:
````Output:
JavaScript
````
The expression doesn't changes the string stored in the variable word . So we can say the string  is immutuable 
```javascript
let num=3
let numtwo=3
console.log(num==numtwo)
let js='JavaScript'
let py='Python'
console.log(js==py)
let lighton=true
let lightoff=false
console.log(lighton==lighoff)
```
Output:
````Output
true
false
false
````
## Non Primitive Data Types
Non Primitive data types are modifiable or mutuable
 We can modify the value of non primitive data types after getting created.
 # Array: 
 1) An arrray is a list of the data values in a square bracket
 2) Array values contain referenced by their reference
 3) Array Index starts from 0.
 ```javascript
 let nums=[1,2,3]
 nums[0]=10
 console.log(nums)
 ```
 Output:
 ````[ 10, 2, 3 ]````
 <br>
 As we can see the array is immutuable 
 Even if the two non primiitve data types have same value they are not considered to be equal
 ```javascript
 let nums=[1,2,3]
 let num=[1,2,3]
 console.log(nums==num)
 let userone={
    name:'Varsha',
    role:'Learner'
 }
 let userTwo={
    nmae:'Varsha',
    role:'Learner'
 }
 console.log(userone==userTwo)
```
Output:
````output
false
false
````
# Second Section
## Numbers:
Numbers are integers and decimal values which can perform the arithmetic operations
## Declaring Numbers Data Types:
```javascript
let age =35
let gravity=9.81
let mass=72
let pi=3.14
const bp=100
const bodytemp=37
console.log(age,gravity,mass, pi,bp,bodytemp)
```
Output :
````Output:
35 9.81 72 3.14 100 37
````

# Math Object
In the javascript math object provides a lot of the methods to work with the numbers
```javascript

const pi=3.14
console.log(pi)
```
Output:
````Output:
3.14
round: 3
````
Math functions 
```javascript
console.log("round:",Math.round(pi))
console.log("Math.round(9.81):",Math.round(9.81))
console.log("(Math.floor(pi))",Math.floor(pi))
console.log("(Math.ceil(pi))",Math.ceil(pi))
console.log("Math.min(-5,4,3,9):",Math.min(-5,4,3,9))
console.log("Math.max(-5,4,3,9)",Math.max(-5,4,3,9))
```
Output:
````output:
Math.round(9.81): 10
(Math.floor(pi)) 3
(Math.ceil(pi)) 4
Math.min(-5,4,3,9): -5
Math.max(-5,4,3,9) 9
````
Random values in the MAth objext:
```javascript
const rand=Math.random()
console.log("Random value",rand)
const num=Math.random()*11
console.log("Taking the random value:",num)
```
Output:
````Output:
Random value 0.36277089224600534
Taking the random value: 0.7984686401743688
````
Other Math functions:
```javascript
console.log("Math.abs(-11):",Math.abs(-11))
console.log("Math.sqrt(4)",Math.sqrt(4))
console.log("Math.sqrt(14)",Math.sqrt(14))
console.log("LN2 value",Math.LN2)
console.log("log 10",Math.log(10))
console.log("Sin 0 value:",Math.sin(0))
```
Output:
````Output:
Math.abs(-11): 11
Math.sqrt(4) 2
Math.sqrt(14) 3.7416573867739413
LN2 value 0.6931471805599453
log 10 2.302585092994046
Sin 0 value: 0
````
## Strings
Strings are texts, which are under single , double, back-tick quote. To declare a string, we need a variable name, assignment operator, a value under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote. Let's see some examples of strings:
```javascript
let space=' '
let first='Jonnapalli'
let last ='Varsha'
let country ='India'
let quote ="The saying ,'Seeing is Believing' -js"
let quotewithbacktick=`the saying ,'SEeing'`
console.log(space)
console.log(first,last,country,quote,quotewithbacktick)
````
Output:
````Output:
 
Jonnapalli Varsha India The saying ,'Seeing is Believing' -js the saying ,'SEeing'
````
## String Concatenation
Connecting two or more strings together is called concatenation
```Javascript
let space=' '
let first='Jonnapalli'
let last ='Varsha'

console.log(first+space+last)
```
Output: 
````Output: 
Jonnapalli Varsha
````
## Long Literal Strings
A string could be a single character or paragraph or a page. If the string length is too big it does not fit in one line. We can use the backslash character (\) at the end of each line to indicate that the string will continue on the next line
```Javascript
const paragraph = "My name is Asabeneh Yetayeh. I live in Finland, Helsinki.\
I am a teacher and I love teaching. I teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, \
Node.js, Python, Data Analysis and D3.js for anyone who is interested to learn. \
In the end of 2019, I was thinking to expand my teaching and to reach \
to global audience and I started a Python challenge from November 20 - December 19.\
I hope you are enjoying too."

console.log(paragraph)
```
Output:
````Output:
My name is Asabeneh Yetayeh. I live in Finland, Helsinki.I am a teacher and I love teaching. I teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Python, Data Analysis and D3.js for anyone who is interested to learn. In the end of 2019, I was thinking to expand my teaching and to reach to global audience and I started a Python challenge from November 20 - December 19.I hope you are enjoying too.

## Template Literals (Template Strings)
To create a template strings, we use two back-ticks. We can inject data as expressions inside a template string. To inject data, we enclose the expression with a curly bracket({}) preceded by a $ sign. See the syntax below.
```javascript
console.log(`The sum of 2 and 3 is 5`)              // statically writing the data
let a = 2
let b = 3
console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}`) 
```
Output:
````Output:
The sum of 2 and 3 is 5
The sum of 2 and 3 is 5
````
